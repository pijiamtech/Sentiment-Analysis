Thank you so much for your videos ma’am! I was never much of a painter growing up and a few months I don’t know what inspired me to buy some supplies and just start blending colours on paper. Your videos have taught me so much and I recreated the Hawaiian night sky and the ship silhouette in the blue sky background and my friends and family couldn’t stop raving about it. Is there any way I could share those paintings with you? I’d love to show you how you’ve inspired an absolute non painter to give it a try and then fall in love with the art.

But when I used a different watercolor paper I did run into these type of problems, like stained paper or paper getting ripped when I was removing art masking fluid. So I think it's your paper. I like Arches best. The quality is amazing. Never had once any issues. Thank you!",0,0,08/03/2017

Maria Raczynska  Thank You!  What about in the bottle... Does it gum up the tip of the bottle at all?,0,1,08/01/2017
"thank you Shannon :) I didn't feel like it gummed up.. once it's dry, it's easy to paint over it (without worrying about picking it up with your brush) and very easy to remove it. It's very helpful if you want to preserve smaller white areas :)",0,1,08/01/2017
